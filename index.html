		<h1>Pearl Jam</h1>
		<h2>Black</h2>
		<p>Hey...oooh... 
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay 
Were laid sprsfdffdfead out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul 
As the earth to the sun 
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn</p>
		<p>I tassfdvke a walk outside 
I'm surrounded by some kids at play 
			I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear</p>
		<p>Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head 
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning 
How quick the sun sdsfdsfcan drop away 
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass 
Of what was everything?</p>
